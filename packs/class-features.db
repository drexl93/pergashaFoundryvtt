Also, the doppelkin will have inventory space appropriate for its build and size given proper containers or gear.</p>\n<p>The doppelkin obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. The doppelkin’s natural impulse is to stay near and defend you. On your turn if you have line of sight on your companion, you can telepathically command the doppelkin where to move (no action required by you).</p>\n<p>You can use your bonus action to telepathically command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action.

The doppelkin never requires your command to use its reaction such as when making an opportunity attack.</p>\n<p>If your doppelkin companion dies, you can obtain another companion by creating another hatchery and waiting for it to develop. You can obtain more doppelkin geodes or oozes through bartering with collectors or spending a day searching in areas where they are known to be found.</p>\n<p>To change the form of your doppelkin requires a freshly slain or properly preserved sample of the target creature.
